# Admin-client-project
This is the front end application to download, edit and save changes to the JSON file on the server at https://adminapi-jeu0.onrender.com
The scenario is that the JSON contains data which is parsed  and displayed in a different user application, to let users list their skills and apply for jobs.
This admin app would be used as a kind of CRM by the owner of that user site.
It allows the questions asked of candidates and the info passed on to the recruiting firm to be edited without having to take down the production site.
